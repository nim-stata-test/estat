# Phase 5: Experimental Design

## Randomized Crossover Intervention Study for Heating Strategy Optimization

---

## 1. Study Overview

### 1.1 Objective
Evaluate three heating control strategies in a real-world setting to determine which optimizes the trade-off between comfort, energy efficiency, and cost.

### 1.2 Study Design
| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Type** | Randomized crossover intervention study |
| **Duration** | 20 weeks (November 2027 - March 2028) |
| **Block length** | 4 days per condition |
| **Washout period** | 2 days (excluded from analysis) |
| **Measurement period** | 2 days (used for analysis) |
| **Conditions** | 3 strategies |
| **Total blocks** | 35 blocks (~11 per strategy) |
| **Statistical power** | >95% to detect +0.30 COP change |
| **Randomization** | Latin square with weather stratification |

### 1.3 Data-Driven Parameter Estimates

These parameters were estimated from 69 days of historical data using `src/phase5/estimate_study_parameters.py`:

| Parameter | Value | Basis |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Heating response time (τ_effort)** | 12.4 hours | Weighted average from transfer function model |
| **Washout period** | 37 hours (2 days) | 3×τ_effort = 95% equilibrium, rounded |
| **COP residual std** | 0.21 | After HDD adjustment (R²=0.93) |
| **Minimum detectable effect** | +0.25 COP | 80% power threshold |

**Note on τ_effort:** The Phase 3 thermal model uses a transfer function approach with separate time constants for outdoor temperature response (τ_outdoor: 24-120h) and heating effort response (τ_effort: 8-48h). For washout calculation, we use τ_effort because it represents how quickly indoor temperature equilibrates after changing heating parameters.

### 1.4 Primary Research Questions
1. Which strategy achieves the best COP while maintaining comfort?
2. How much grid consumption can be reduced by shifting heating to solar hours?
3. What is the cost savings potential of tariff-aware scheduling?
4. Are there strategy × weather interactions that inform adaptive control?

## 2. Controllable Parameters

### 2.1 Parameter Summary

| Parameter | Symbol | Range | How to Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------------|
| Comfort start time | `t_comfort_start` | 06:00 - 12:00 | Heat pump scheduler |
| Comfort end time | `t_comfort_end` | 16:00 - 22:00 | Heat pump scheduler |
| Setpoint (comfort) | `T_setpoint_comfort` | 19 - 22°C | Home Assistant climate entity |
| Setpoint (eco) | `T_setpoint_eco` | **12 - 19°C** | Home Assistant climate entity |
| Curve rise (Steilheit) | `curve_rise` | 0.80 - 1.20 | Heat pump interface menu |

**Note on Eco Setpoint Range:** Phase 2 multivariate analysis revealed that eco setpoint has minimal effect on daytime comfort (-0.09°C per 1°C change). This allows aggressive eco setbacks down to 12°C (frost protection level) without compromising comfort during occupied hours (08:00-22:00).

### 2.2 Parameter Change Locations

#### Heat Pump Interface (Stiebel Eltron ISG)
- **Schedule timing**: Menu → Time Programs → Heating → Set comfort period start/end
- **Curve rise**: Menu → Heating → Heating Curve → Steilheit (slope)

#### Home Assistant
- **Setpoints**: Climate entity → Set target temperature
  - Comfort mode: Set during comfort hours
  - Eco mode: Set during eco hours
- **Automation**: Optional scripts for scheduled setpoint changes

### 2.3 Derived Parameters

The heating curve model determines flow temperature:
```
T_flow = T_setpoint + curve_rise × (T_ref - T_outdoor)
```

Where:
- `T_ref` = 21.32°C (comfort mode) or 19.18°C (eco mode)
- Lower `curve_rise` → lower flow temp → higher COP (~+0.10 COP per 1°C reduction)

---

## 3. Strategy Definitions

**Strategy Selection Method:** Strategies B and C were selected from 21 Pareto-optimal solutions
generated by NSGA-II multi-objective optimization (`src/phase4/04_pareto_optimization.py`).
The optimizer explored 5 decision variables across 4 objectives (comfort, grid, cost, min temp).

Key insight from Pareto optimization: All optimal strategies converge to:
- Short comfort window (~4h) aligned with solar peak (11:00-16:00)
- Aggressive eco setback (12-14°C) - minimal effect on daytime comfort
- High comfort setpoint (22°C) during the short comfort window

---

### 3.1 Strategy A: Baseline (Control)
Current system settings serving as reference.

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Comfort start | **06:30** | Early morning pre-heat |
| Comfort end | **20:00** | Evening cooldown |
| Setpoint comfort | **20.2°C** | Current winter setting |
| Setpoint eco | **18.5°C** | Night/away setting |
| Curve rise | **1.08** | Factory default |

**Expected outcomes**: Grid ~1200 kWh, Cost ~320 CHF (64-day simulation period)

---

### 3.2 Strategy B: Grid-Minimal (Pareto-Optimized)
Minimize grid electricity import. Selected from Pareto front (Jan 2026 optimization, 5% constraint).

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Comfort start | **09:00** | Aligned with solar peak |
| Comfort end | **16:00** | 7h comfort window |
| Setpoint comfort | **22.0°C** | Higher comfort during short window |
| Setpoint eco | **12.0°C** | Aggressive setback (Pareto-optimal) |
| Curve rise | **0.89** | Balanced for comfort constraint |

**Expected outcomes**: Grid 2235 kWh, Cost 704 CHF, Violation 4.5%, Min temp 17.3°C (52-day simulation)

**Rationale:** Lowest grid import on Pareto front while meeting 5% violation constraint.
The aggressive eco setback (12.0°C) has minimal effect on daytime comfort. Higher curve_rise
(0.89 vs 0.83) ensures adequate heating during cold periods.

---

### 3.3 Strategy C: Balanced (Pareto-Optimized)
Balance comfort and energy efficiency. Selected from Pareto front (Jan 2026 optimization, 5% constraint).

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Comfort start | **10:00** | Aligned with solar peak |
| Comfort end | **16:00** | 6h comfort window |
| Setpoint comfort | **21.9°C** | Higher comfort during short window |
| Setpoint eco | **12.1°C** | Aggressive setback (Pareto-optimal) |
| Curve rise | **0.90** | Balanced for comfort constraint |

**Expected outcomes**: Grid 2239 kWh, Cost 703 CHF, Violation 4.7%, Min temp 17.3°C (52-day simulation)

**Rationale:** Best trade-off between grid and cost while meeting 5% violation constraint.
Similar parameters to Grid-Minimal with slightly later start for marginally lower cost.

---

## 4. Randomization Schedule

### 4.1 Design Principles
- **Latin square**: Each strategy appears once in each season tercile
- **Weather stratification**: Balance cold/mild periods across strategies
- **Carryover balance**: No strategy follows itself

### 4.2 Schedule Generation
Run the schedule generator before study start:
```bash
python src/phase5/generate_schedule.py --start 2027-11-01 --weeks 20 --seed 42
```

Output: `output/phase5/block_schedule.csv`

### 4.3 Example Schedule Structure

| Block | Start Date | End Date | Strategy | Season | Washout | Measurement |
|-------|------------|----------|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | 2027-11-01 | 2027-11-05 | C | Early | Nov 1-3 | Nov 4-5 |
| 2 | 2027-11-06 | 2027-11-10 | B | Early | Nov 6-8 | Nov 9-10 |
| 3 | 2027-11-11 | 2027-11-15 | C | Early | Nov 11-13 | Nov 14-15 |
| 4 | 2027-11-16 | 2027-11-20 | A | Early | Nov 16-18 | Nov 19-20 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 4.4 Season Definitions
- **Early winter**: Nov 1 - Dec 15 (blocks 1-9)
- **Mid winter**: Dec 16 - Feb 15 (blocks 10-21)
- **Late winter**: Feb 16 - Mar 21 (blocks 22-28)

---

## 5. Block Transition Protocol

### 5.1 Transition Timing
- **Change time**: 00:00 (midnight) on block day 1
- **Washout period**: Days 1-3 (72 hours, excluded from analysis)
- **Measurement period**: Days 4-5 (48 hours, used for analysis)
- **Block ends**: 23:59 on day 5

The 3-day washout is based on the building's thermal time constant (19.3 hours). After 3 tau (~58 hours), the system reaches 95% of the new equilibrium.

### 5.2 Step-by-Step Parameter Change Procedure

#### Before Transition (Evening Before)
1. [ ] Verify current block data is complete
2. [ ] Review next block's strategy parameters
3. [ ] Prepare any manual changes needed

#### At Transition Time (00:00)
1. [ ] **Heat pump scheduler**: Set new comfort start/end times
2. [ ] **Curve rise**: Navigate to Heating Curve menu, adjust Steilheit
3. [ ] **Home Assistant**: Update climate entity setpoints
4. [ ] **Log**: Record exact change time in block log

#### Verification (Morning After)
1. [ ] Confirm schedule is active (check heat pump display)
2. [ ] Verify setpoints responded correctly
3. [ ] Check sensor data logging is operational

### 5.3 Parameter Change Quick Reference

```
STRATEGY A (Baseline):
  Schedule: 06:30 - 20:00
  Setpoints: Comfort 20.2°C, Eco 18.5°C
  Curve rise: 1.08

STRATEGY B (Grid-Minimal, Pareto-Optimized, 5% constraint):
  Schedule: 09:00 - 16:00
  Setpoints: Comfort 22.0°C, Eco 12.0°C
  Curve rise: 0.89

STRATEGY C (Balanced, Pareto-Optimized, 5% constraint):
  Schedule: 10:00 - 16:00
  Setpoints: Comfort 21.9°C, Eco 12.1°C
  Curve rise: 0.90
```

**Note:** Strategies B and C use aggressive eco setpoints (~12°C). Phase 2 analysis confirmed
this has minimal effect on daytime comfort (-0.09°C per 1°C change). The higher curve_rise
(0.89-0.90) compared to earlier optimizations (0.83) ensures the 5% violation constraint is met.

## 8. Outcome Measures

### 8.1 Primary Outcomes

| Outcome | Definition | Unit | Target |
|---------|------------|------|--------|
| **Average Temperature** | Mean T_weighted during 08:00-22:00 | °C | Maximize |
| **Violation %** | % time T_weighted < 18.5°C during 08:00-22:00 | % | ≤5% (constraint) |
| **Grid per HDD** | External supply ÷ Heating degree days | kWh/HDD | Minimize |
| **COP** | Heat produced ÷ Electricity consumed | - | Maximize |
| **Net cost per HDD** | (Import×rate - Export×feedin) ÷ HDD | CHF/HDD | Minimize |

### 8.2 Secondary Outcomes

| Outcome | Definition | Unit |
|---------|------------|------|
| Solar utilization | % heating during solar hours | % |
| Battery contribution | Battery discharge for heating | kWh |
| Peak flow temperature | Max T_flow observed | °C |
| Compressor cycles | Number of on/off cycles | count |

### 8.3 Comfort Constraint

**Constraint Definition:**
- T_weighted must not be below 18.5°C for more than **5%** of daytime hours (08:00-22:00)
- There is **no upper temperature limit** - higher temperatures are always acceptable
- This constraint applies equally to all strategies

| Strategy | Min Threshold | Max Threshold | Evaluation Hours |
|----------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| All strategies | 18.5°C | None | 08:00-22:00 |

**Rationale:** The optimization framework uses three objectives (maximize average temperature, minimize grid import, minimize net cost) with a soft constraint on low-temperature violations. The 5% limit was tightened from 20% after evaluation showed energy-optimized strategies had 15-19% violation and minimum temperatures of 16.7°C with the looser constraint.

**Note:** All comfort metrics are evaluated using T_weighted (see Section 8.4).

### 8.4 Weighted Indoor Temperature Definition

The comfort objective uses a weighted combination of five indoor temperature sensors:

```
T_weighted = 0.40×davis_inside + 0.30×office1 + 0.10×atelier + 0.10×studio + 0.10×simlab
```

| Sensor | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| `davis_inside_temperature` | 40% | Primary living area, central location |
| `office1_temperature` | 30% | Secondary occupied workspace |
| `atelier_temperature` | 10% | Zone coverage - workshop area |
| `studio_temperature` | 10% | Zone coverage - studio space |
| `simlab_temperature` | 10% | Zone coverage - laboratory area |

**Rationale for weighting:**
- Higher weights for frequently occupied spaces (davis_inside, office1)
- Lower weights for peripheral zones to capture whole-building response
- Weights sum to 1.0 for interpretable temperature values
- Same weights used in Phase 3 thermal modeling for consistency

**Missing sensor handling:** If a sensor is temporarily unavailable, its weight is redistributed proportionally among available sensors.

## 9. Safety Protocol

### 9.1 Hard Limits (Automatic Abort)

| Parameter | Limit | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Min room temperature | < 16°C | Revert to Baseline immediately |
| Max flow temperature | > 48°C | Check heat pump, reduce curve_rise |
| Heat pump error | Any fault code | Pause study, resolve issue |

### 9.2 Soft Limits (Review Required)

| Parameter | Limit | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Violation % > 30% | For 24 hours | Document, consider adjustment |
| COP < 3.0 | Single day | Check conditions, verify data |
| Manual override | Any | Document reason, include in analysis |

### 9.3 Study Pause Criteria
- Equipment malfunction requiring repair
- Extended absence (> 7 days)
- Unusual weather event (e.g., power outage)
- Request from household member

---

## 10. Statistical Analysis Plan

### 10.1 Primary Analysis

Mixed-effects linear regression:
```
Y ~ Strategy + HDD + Solar_hours + Season + (1|Block)
```

Where:
- `Y` = outcome (grid_per_HDD, COP, cost_per_HDD)
- `Strategy` = factor (A, B, C, D)
- `HDD` = heating degree days (covariate)
- `Solar_hours` = daily solar availability (covariate)
- `Season` = early/mid/late winter (factor)
- `(1|Block)` = random block effect

### 10.2 Pairwise Comparisons

- Compare each optimized strategy vs Baseline
- Tukey HSD adjustment for multiple comparisons
- Report effect size with 95% CI

### 10.3 Subgroup Analyses

- Strategy × Weather interaction (cold vs mild days)
- Strategy × Season interaction
- Weekday vs weekend effects

### 10.4 Sample Size Justification

Based on power analysis using historical data (`src/phase5/estimate_study_parameters.py`):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| COP residual std (after HDD adjustment) | 0.21 |
| Minimum detectable effect | +0.25 COP (80% power) |
| Expected effect (Energy-Optimized) | +0.30 COP |
| Blocks per strategy | 7 |
| Statistical power | 93% |
| α | 0.05 (two-sided) |

**Key insight**: HDD explains 92.5% of COP variance. Using HDD as a covariate in the analysis reduces residual variance by 73%, enabling detection of smaller effects with fewer blocks.

## 13. Appendices

### Appendix A: Heating Curve Reference

The heat pump uses a heating curve to determine flow temperature based on outdoor temperature:

```
T_flow = T_setpoint + curve_rise × (T_ref - T_outdoor)
```

Where T_ref = 21.32°C (comfort mode) or 19.18°C (eco mode).

Example calculations during **comfort mode** (T_outdoor = 0°C):

| Strategy | Setpoint | Curve Rise | T_ref | T_flow |
|----------|----------|------------|-------|--------|
| Baseline | 20.2°C | 1.08 | 21.3°C | 43.2°C |
| Grid-Minimal | 22.0°C | 0.89 | 21.3°C | 41.0°C |
| Balanced | 21.9°C | 0.90 | 21.3°C | 41.1°C |

Example calculations during **eco mode** (T_outdoor = 0°C):

| Strategy | Setpoint | Curve Rise | T_ref | T_flow |
|----------|----------|------------|-------|--------|
| Baseline | 18.5°C | 1.08 | 19.2°C | 39.2°C |
| Grid-Minimal | 12.0°C | 0.89 | 19.2°C | 29.1°C |
| Balanced | 12.1°C | 0.90 | 19.2°C | 29.4°C |

**Note:** The Pareto-optimized strategies (B, C) use much lower eco flow temperatures
(~29°C vs 39°C baseline), significantly reducing heat pump energy consumption
during non-solar hours. The higher curve_rise (0.89-0.90 vs earlier 0.83) ensures
adequate comfort during cold periods while meeting the 5% violation constraint.

### Appendix B: Tariff Schedule Reference

| Period | Hours | Rate Type | Purchase (Rp/kWh) |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Mon-Fri | 06:00-21:00 | High | 35.9 |
| Mon-Fri | 21:00-06:00 | Low | 27.7 |
| Saturday | 06:00-12:00 | High | 35.9 |
| Saturday | 12:00-24:00 | Low | 27.7 |
| Sunday | All day | Low | 27.7 |
| Holidays | All day | Low | 27.7 |
